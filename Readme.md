In this repo, you find the theses and papers published as a part of the [CPS-VO] Challenge 2018. The competition requires Bachelor students to demonstrate that an autonomous UAV can search through the desert and pick up a dead UAV and restore it to the base. In this competition, "Team Halmstad" of Halmstad University secured second place and also won a special mention "Best UAV design award".

The drone which was named as F651 is a hexacopter built from a DJI F550 frame. The complete drone was built from scratch by six bachelor students as a part of their Bachelor thesis work.
1. The [Drone] body, its grippers design and the complete hardware system were designed and built by two Mechatronics Engineering students - Anders Bogga and Emil Andersson.

2. The [coverage] planning, object detection and pickup was developed by two Competer Science Engineering students - Patrik Karlsson and Emil Johansson.

3. The [altitude] control and obstacle avoidance was developed by two Electrical Engineering students - Marcus Roden and Jakob Carlsen.
