# About this Repo
In this repo, you find the theses and papers published as a part of the [CPS-VO] Challenge 2018. The competition requires Bachelor students to demonstrate that an autonomous UAV can search through the desert and pick up a dead UAV and restore it to the base. In this competition, "Team Halmstad" of Halmstad University secured second place and also won a special mention "Best UAV design award".
The team consists of 6 Bachelor students, 4 Doctoral students and an Assistant Supervisor.

# Theses
The drone which was named as F651 is a hexacopter built from a DJI F550 frame. The complete drone was built from scratch by six bachelor students as a part of their Bachelor thesis work. The coordinator from the University for the competition was [Maytheewat Aramrattana].
1. The [Drone] body, its grippers design and the complete hardware system were designed and built by two Mechatronics Engineering students - [Anders Bogga] and [Emil Andersson] supervised by [Wojciech Mostowski].

2. The [coverage] planning, object detection and pickup was developed by two Computer Science Engineering students - [Patrik Karlsson] and [Emil Johansson] supervised by [Mahsa Varshosaz].

3. The [altitude] control and obstacle avoidance was developed by two Electrical Engineering students - [Marcus Roden] and [Jakob Carlsen] supervised by [Yuantao Fan] and [Jennifer David].
